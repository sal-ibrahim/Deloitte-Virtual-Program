# Deloitte-Virtual-Program

This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte Virtual Program. In this program, I am tasked to help Daikibo Industrials (a global leader in manufacturing of heavy machinery) with a variety of problems that they are facing.

## Task 01 - Coding

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half in another. They need help to combine the two files.

By completing this task, I learned how to manipulate json files using Python scripts as well as how to use unittest framework to write and run test for a python code.

## Task 02 - Data Analysis

Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

By completing this task, I learned how to use Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that helps the Daikibo's tech team to answer their questions.

## Task 04 - Cyber Security

A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information about Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached.

By completing this task, I learned how to read web log files, and how to identify spot suspicious requests.

## Proposal

By completing this task, I learned how to draft a concise software development proposal.
